This project was developed for Istinye University Image Proccesing course

For Windows computers we recommend using it with package manager applications such as anaconda or miniconda. 

For Linux and Unix computers you can use the following code
bash$>pip install -r requirements.txt

You can freely experiment with image processing techniques on a randomly selected image

Good luck :)
